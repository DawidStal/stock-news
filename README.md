## Stock News
The Stock News Alert System is a program that monitors the price of a chosen stock and sends SMS notifications if the stock price changes by more than 3% within a single day.

It uses the Alpha Vantage API to get information of the stock prices, gets news articles from the News API and sends SMS messages using the Twilio API.
